                <h3>The Window Object</h3>
                <h4>The Browser Object Model</h4>
                <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods
                    that contain information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find
                    out which browser the users are utilising (though, this method is unreliable), the
                    dimensions of their screens, and which pages they have visited before the current page. It
                    can also be used for the rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, if you’re into
                    annoying your users.</p>
                <p>There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number of properties and
                    methods that are supported by all the major browsers, making a sort of de facto standard.
                    These properties and methods are made available through the window object. Every
                    browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</p>
                <h4>Going Global</h4>
                <p>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the
                    global object is the window object. This means that any global variable created is actually a
                    property of the window object.</p>
                <h4>The Browser History</h4>
                <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously
                    visited pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5
                    History API.</p>
                <p>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before
                    arriving at the current page.</p>
                <p>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the
                    current page:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        window.history.go(1); // goes forward 1 page
                        window.history.go(0); // reloads the current page
                        window.history.go(-1); // goes back 3 pages   
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <h4>Controlling Windows</h4>
                <p>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of
                    the page to be opened as its first parameter, and a list of attributes as the second parameter.
                    This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the
                    code:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        popup = window.open(‘https://sitepoint.com’,‘SitePoint’,‘width=400,
                        ↵height=400,resizable=yes’);                           
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>The window.close() method can be used to close a window:</p>
                <code>popup.close();</code>
                <p>It is also possible to move a window using the window.move() method. This takes two
                    parameters that are the X and Y coordinates of the screen that the window is to be moved
                    to:</p>
                <code>indow.moveTo(0,0); // will move the window to the top-left corner
                    ↵of the screen</code>
                <p>You can resize a window using the window.resizeTo() method. This takes two
                    parameters that specify the width and height of the resized window’s dimensions:</p>
                <code>window.resizeTo(600,400);</code>
                <h4>Cookies</h4>
                <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by
                    Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a
                    browser does not remember anything from one request to another. So every time a user
                    visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered. Cookies can be used to
                    sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests.
                    </p>
                <p>A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page from the same domain
                    that set them. This is to stop sites being able to access information about users, such as
                    other sites they have visited. Cookies are also limited to storing up to 4KB of data,
                    although 20 cookies are allowed per domain, which can add up to quite a lot of data.
                    </p>
                <p>Cookies can be used for personalising a user’s browsing experience, storing user
                    preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and
                    tracking users. The use of cookies for tracking purposes has been much maligned in recent
                    years.
                    </p>
                <h4>Creating Cookies</h4>
                <p>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar,” the document.cookie
                    property, like so:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        document.cookie = “name=Superman”
                        << “name=Superman”
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>The document.cookie property acts like a special type of string. Assigning another cookie
                    to it won’t overwrite the entire property, it will just append it to the end of the string. So
                    we can add more cookies by assigning them to document.cookie:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        document.cookie = “hero=true”
                        << “hero=true”
                        document.cookie = “city=Metropolis”
                        << “city=Metropolis”   
                    </pre>
                </code>

                <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
                <h4>The data- Attribute</h4>
                <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that
                    are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so shouldn’t be used by an
                    external service: their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means that
                    they are perfect for adding data to be used either by an external API or as a hook that the
                    program utilizes to access a particular element on the page.
                    </p>
                <p>The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the
                    following format: <br>
                    start with data <br> contain only lowercase letters
                    <br> include an optional string value
                    <br> Examples could be:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        data-toppings=“ham & pineapple”
                        data-hero=“true”
                        data-dropdown
                        data-user=“DAZ”
                        data-max-length=“32”
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <h4>HTML5 APIs</h4>
                <p>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to the
                    hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware
                    evolves quickly and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access and control
                    new features that appear in the latest devices.
                    In this section, we’ll look at some of the more popular APIs that are already supported in
                    most modern browsers; however, due to the ever-changing nature of most APIs, it is still
                    best practice to use object-detection tests before using any of the API methods.
