                <h3>Forms</h3>
                <p>Forms are made up of a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element that contains form controls such as input
                    fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is
                    processed once the form has been submitted.</p>
                <h4>A Searching Example</h4>
                <p>We’ll start off with a simple example of a form that contains one input field, and a button to submit
                    a search query, not unlike the one used by Google. This example doesn’t use any styles; you just
                    need to create a file called <code>search.html</code> that contains the following code:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        &lt;!doctype html&gt;
                        &lt;html lang='en'&gt;
                        &lt;head&gt;
                            &lt;meta charset='utf-8'&gt;
                            &lt;title&gt;Search&lt;/title&gt;
                        &lt;/head&gt;
                        &lt;body&gt;
                            &lt;form name='search' action='/search'&gt;
                                &lt;input name='searchInput'&gt;
                                &lt;button type='submit'&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;
                            &lt;/form>
                        &lt;script src='main.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                        &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;   
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>This form has a <code>name</code> attribute of <code>search</code> , and contains two controls: an
                    input field where a user can enter a search phrase, and a button to submit the form. The form can
                    also be submitted by pressing Enter.</p>
                <p>The <code>action</code> attribute is the URL that the form will be submitted to so it can be
                    processed on the server side. The input field also has a <code>name</code> attribute of
                    <code>searchInput</code> that is used to access the information inside it.</p>
                <p>You should also create a file called <code>main.js</code> to put the JavaScript in. This can be saved
                    in the same directory as <code>search.html</code> .</p>
                <h4>Accessing Form Elements</h4>
                <code>const form = document.forms[0];</code><br>
                <code>const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];</code><br>
                <code>const form = document.forms.search;</code><br>
                <code>const form = document.forms['search'];</code><br>
                <code>const [input,button] = form.elements;</code><br>
                <code>const input = form.searchInput</code><br>
                <code>const input = form['searchInput']</code><br>
                <h4>Form Properties and Methods</h4>
                <p>Form objects have a number of useful properties and methods that can be used to interact with the
                    form.</p>
                <p>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. Note that submitting a form using this
                    method won’t trigger the form submit event that's covered in the next section.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        &lt;button type='submit'&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt; 
                        &lt;input type='submit' value='Submit'&gt; 
                        &lt;input type='image' src='button.png'&gt;     
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in
                    the HTML.</p>
                <code>&lt;button type='reset'&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;</code>
                <h4>Form Controls</h4>
                <p>Some common types of form control are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and
                        file uploads</li>
                    <li> <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
                    <li> <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> elements for longer text entry</li>
                    <li> <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Input Fields</h4>
                <p>Input fields are the most common types of form control, but there are several categories of input
                    field as you’ll soon see.</p>

                <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
                <p>Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world.
                    There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. I’m going to use
                    my juicer to illustrate how each of these concepts can be applied in a programming environment,
                    since the juicer can be considered an object. It’s a wonderful machine that makes fresh juice for me
                    every morning. In many ways, my juicer can be thought of as an object, as it has properties such as
                    speed and capacity, and also has methods or actions it can perform, such as juicing, switching on
                    and switching off.</p>
                <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
                <p>When I use my juicer, I put the fruit into the machine, press the 'on' button and out comes the
                    juice. I haven’t a clue how it does it—only that it makes a very loud noise! This demonstrates the
                    concept of encapsulation: the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the
                    essential functionalities are exposed to the end user, such as the 'on' button. In OOP, this
                    involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to
                    implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to knowhowit’s done.</p>
                <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
                <p>My juicer isn't the only appliance I own that has an 'on' button, although the way the on button
                    works is slightly different for each appliance. My juicer also uses the same electrical outlet as
                    other appliances in my kitchen. I can also place various types of fruit into it and it still juices
                    them. These examples demonstrate the concept of polymorphism: the same process can be used for
                    different objects. In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the
                    ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
                <h4>Inheritance</h4>
                <p>I’d really like the next model up from my juicer, as it can deal with more types of fruit and it’s a
                    bit quieter. Even though it has these extra features, I’m sure that inside it uses many of the same
                    parts that my juicer has. This demonstrates the concept of inheritance: taking the features of one
                    object then adding some new features. In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists
                    and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new
                    properties and methods.</p>
                <h4>Classes</h4>
                <p>Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known asclass-basedlanguages. This is
                    because they use a class to define a blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an
                    instance of that class, and inherit all the properties and methods of the class. In my juicer
                    example, the juicer class would represent the design of the juicer, and each juicer that’s made on
                    the production line would be instances of that class.</p>
                <p>JavaScript didn't have classes before ES6, and used the concept of using actual objects as the
                    blueprint for creating more objects. This is known as aprototype-basedlanguage. In the juicer
                    example, this might involve building an actual prototype juicer then using this prototype as the
                    basis for making all the other juicers. The juicers based on the prototype would be able to do
                    everything the prototype could do, with some being able to do even more. Even though ES6 now
                    supports classes, it still uses this prototypal inheritance model in the background.</p>

                <h3>Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
                <h4>Libraries</h4>
                <p>A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve
                    common tasks. JavaScript is an extremely flexible language that can accomplish most programming
                    tasks – but not all undertakings are as easy to do as they should be. A library will abstract
                    functionality into easier-to-use functions and methods. These can then be used to complete common
                    tasks without having to use lots of repetitive code.</p>
                <h4>jQuery</h4>
                <p>jQuery is the most popular of all the JavaScript libraries used today, as seen in these statistics
                    onW3TechsandBuilt With.. It is used in a huge number of commercial websites and has a plugin system
                    that makes it easy to extend and use to build common web page elements, such as a lightbox or
                    carousel widget.</p>
