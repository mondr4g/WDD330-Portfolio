                <h3>Client-side form validation</h3>
                <p>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled
                    out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data
                    submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.</p>
                <h3>What is form validation?</h3>
                <p>When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the
                    correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is
                    called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.
                    In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.</p>
                <h3>Different types of client-side validation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which we've discussed in many
                        places throughout this module. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript.
                        Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable
                        as JavaScript validation.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but
                        you need to create it all (or use a library).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Using built-in form validation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.
                    </li>
                    <li>minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)</li>
                    <li>min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types</li>
                    <li>type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific
                        preset type.</li>
                    <li>pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Using Fetch</h3>
                <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP
                    pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an
                    easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</p>
                <p>This kind of functionality was previously achieved using XMLHttpRequest. Fetch provides a better
                    alternative that can be easily used by other technologies such as Service Workers. Fetch also
                    provides a single logical place to define other HTTP-related concepts such as CORS and extensions to
                    HTTP.</p>
                <p>The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in the following significant ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an
                        HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, as soon as the server responds with headers, the Promise will resolve
                        normally (with the ok property of the response set to false if the response isn’t in the range
                        200–299), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from
                        completing.</li>
                    <li>fetch() won’t send cross-origin cookies unless you set the credentials init option. (Since April
                        2018. The spec changed the default credentials policy to same-origin. Firefox changed since
                        61.0b13.)</li>
                </ul>
