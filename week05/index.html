                <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
                <p> Errors and bugs are a fact of life in a programming-they will always be there. A ninja
                    programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors ocurring, and find ways to
                    identify and deal with them quickly when they do occur</p>
                <h4>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h4>
                <p> Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused
                    by one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        system error - there is problem with the system or external devices with which the program is
                        interacting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        programmer error - the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as a
                        typo.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        user error - the user has entered data incorrectly that the program is unable to handle.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors; it didn’t implement
                    exceptions at all until ECMAScript version 3. Instead of alerting a user to an error in a
                    program it just failed silently in the background, and this is sometimes still the case. It
                    might seem like a good idea at first, but the error might give unexpected or incorrect
                    results that nobody spots, or lurk in the background for a long time before causing the
                    program to crash spectacularly. Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to
                    track down.</p>
                <p>For this reason, ninjas should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development
                    so that any errors can be identified and fixed quickly. In production, a ninja should try to
                    make the code fail gracefully (although not completely silently―we still need to know
                    there’s been an error) so that the user experience is not affected, if possible. This is
                    achieved by making sure exceptions are caught and dealt with and code is tested
                    rigorously.</p>
                <h4>Debugging in the Browser</h4>
                <p>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing
                    with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it
                    originated, so you’ll need to run through the program to see what’s happening at different
                    stages of its execution. When doing this, it can be useful to create what are known as
                    breakpoints, which halt the progress of the code and allow us to view the value of
                    different variables at that point in the program. There are a number of options for
                    debugging JavaScript code in the browser.
                    </p>
                <h4>The Trusty Alert</h4>
                <p>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at
                    certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until OK is
                    clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of
                    variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be.</p>
                <h4>Using the Console</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The console.log() method can be used to log the value of variables at different
                        stages of the program, although it will not actually stop executing the program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the console. This
                        will show the functions that were called in the lead up to an exception occurring
                        while the code is running.
                    </li>
                </ul>
